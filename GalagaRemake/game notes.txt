Game Notes
===============================
- you need to add health packs into game
	- extra points for life currently had
	- can have a base point value, so even if your almost at death you can still get a
	  point bonus for collecting the pack, more for more health you have
- each level is going to have its own score
	- after you beat the game you can run all the levels back to back
	  and try and place a score on that
