Design Themes(*will be updated as/if themes change)
-------------------------------------------------
- Every manager should know how to manage their assets for the production of the game
- The orchestrators and the creators need to tell the managers what to do with their part of the production,
	and the managers implement those tasks as needed



TODOs
--------------------------------------------------------
- Scrub world bounds from all parameters, use GameState::WorldBounds in its stead
- Need to move GameState stuff into new LevelState object or just within the levels themselves


Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------
- all sprites need to be placed in C:\Users\Sean McCrobie\source\repos\GalageRemake\GalagaRemake in order to be loaded correctly
