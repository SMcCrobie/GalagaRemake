Design Themes(*will be updated as/if themes change)
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Every manager should know how to manage their assets for the production of the game
- The orchestrators and the creators need to tell the managers what to do with their part of the production,
	and the managers implement those tasks as needed



TODOs
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Add point values to getting items
	- less life needed more points
- Add points representation on screen
	- add points for collecting health packs when already at full health or close to it
- remove control selection widow, tie control changes to function keys instead for now, menus further down the line


- Scrub world bounds from all parameters, use GameState::WorldBounds in its stead
- Need to move GameState stuff into new LevelState object or just within the levels themselves


Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------
- all sprites need to be placed in C:\Users\Sean McCrobie\source\repos\GalageRemake\GalagaRemake in order to be loaded correctly



Code Comments
---------------------------------------------------------------
"this is why you need to standardize ship creation, prob set position before any creation period"
